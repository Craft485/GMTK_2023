# GMTK Game Jam 2023

## Theme: **Roles Reversed**

## Brainstorming

- ~~Reverse Horor~~
- Reverse Clicker Game
  - Try to set some currency to 0 (money? fame?)
  - Difficulty levels?
    - Starting currency count
    - Starting currency per second
    - Building cost?
  - You play as the button
    - Game over if currency = x
    - Run from cursors
- ~~Reverse IRL Game Sim~~
  - ~~Ex: Play as a soccer ball~~
- Reverse Platformer:
  - Control certain aspects of the level instead of the character
  - Character starts walking towards exit after short delay
  - Timer?
  - Custom level loader?
    - Threejs level editor would probabaly be too much for this
    - Could have a json file for each level
    - File broken down into a list of objects with a type, pos, rotation(?), sizing and any other needed information

## Adventures of Brown Box Billy

Get Billy from the green to the blue areas by moving certain parts of the level
